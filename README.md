## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze student performance data and build predictive models to identify key factors influencing GPA. By understanding these factors, we aim to provide insights into improving student performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to student demographics, study habits, extracurricular activities, and academic performance. The dataset is included in the `data` directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different features. This includes:
- Summary statistics
- Correlation matrix and heatmap

## Model Building

Several machine learning models are used to predict student performance, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- SGD Regressor

Models are evaluated using metrics such as RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE, and MSE.
